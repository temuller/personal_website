My interestes lie in type Ia supernovae as distance indicators, the physics of supernovae (like the explosion mechanism and progenitors), and other stellar transients in general (e.g., peculiar supernovae, kilonovae, tidal disruption events, etc.). I am also interested in data science (e.g. deep learning) and coding in Python. 

I am the author of the [PISCOLA](https://github.com/temuller/piscola/) light-curve fitter and an active member of [ePESSTO+](https://www.pessto.org/) where I am incharge of the data-reduction pipeline. Also check my [Astro-Visualization](https://temuller.github.io/astro-visualization/) website. See my [CV](https://temuller.github.io/cv/) for a more detailed description of my background.

Currently, I am a postdoc at the Institute of Space Sciences (ICE-CSIC) in Barcelona, Spain. My current work focuses on using type Ia supernovae with near-infrared data to improve the measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) as part of the [HostFlows](https://hostflows.github.io/) project.
