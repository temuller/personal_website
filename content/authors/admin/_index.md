My interestes lie in supernovae as distance indicators (cosmology), the physics of supernovae (such as explosion mechanism and progenitors), and other stellar transients in general (e.g., kilonovae, tidal disruption events, etc.). I am also interested in machine learning and coding in Python. 

I am the developer of the [PISCOLA](https://github.com/temuller/piscola/) transient light-curve fitter and [HostPhot](https://github.com/temuller/hostphot) for galaxy photometry, and I am an active member in collaborations such as [ePESSTO+](https://www.pessto.org/), [POSIE](https://poise.obs.carnegiescience.edu/), [ZTF](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) and SAINTS. 

Currently, I am a research fellow at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and previously was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Space Sciences (ICE-CSIC) in Barcelona, Spain. At the moment, my work focuses on using type Ia supernovae with near-infrared data to test the current standard cosmological model as part of the [Aarhus-Barcelona Flows](https://flows.phys.au.dk/) project and SAINTS collaboration. 

For more information, check my [CV](https://temuller.github.io/cv/).
