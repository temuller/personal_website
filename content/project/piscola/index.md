**P**ython for **I**ntelligent **S**upernova **CO**smology **L**ight-curve **A**nalysis (**PISCOLA**) is a code I have developed as part of my PhD to fit Type Ia supernova light curves in a data-driven way using Gaussian Process. The post analysis is done with Non-negative Matrix Factorization, a machine learning approach to extract features/parameters from the rest-frame light curves in order to do cosmology (MÃ¼ller-Bravo et al., in prep.).
