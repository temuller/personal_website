abstract = "Low-luminosity type II supernovae (LL SNe II) make up the low explosion energy end of core-collapse SNe, but their study and physical understanding remain limited. We present SN 2016aqf, a LL SN II with extensive spectral and photometric coverage. We measure a $V$-band peak magnitude of $-14.58$ mag, a plateau duration of ~100 days, and an inferred $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.008$ +/- $0.002$ Msun. The peak bolometric luminosity, Lbol ~ 10^{41.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and its spectral evolution is typical of other SNe in the class. Using our late-time spectra, we measure the [O I] λλ$6300, 6364$ lines, which we compare against SN II spectral synthesis models to constrain the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass. We find this to be 12 +/2 3 Msun. Our extensive late-time spectral coverage of the [Fe II] λ$7155$ and [Ni II] λ$7378$ lines permits a measurement of the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, a parameter sensitive to the inner progenitor structure and explosion mechanism dynamics. We measure a constant abundance ratio evolution of $0.081^{+0.009}_{-0.010}$, and argue that the best epochs to measure the ratio are at ~200 -- 300 days after explosion. We place this measurement in the context of a large sample of SNe II and compare against various physical, light-curve and spectral parameters, in search of trends which might allow indirect ways of constraining this ratio. We do not find correlations predicted by theoretical models; however, this may be the result of the exact choice of parameters and explosion mechanism in the models, the simplicity of them and/or primordial contamination in the measured abundance ratio."
