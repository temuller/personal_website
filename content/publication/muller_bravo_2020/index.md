abstract = "Low-luminosity type II supernovae (LL SNe II) make up the low explosion energy end of core-collapse SNe, but their study and physical understanding remain limited. We present SN\\,2016aqf, a LL SN II with extensive spectral and photometric coverage. We measure a $V$-band peak magnitude of $-14.58$\\,mag, a plateau duration of $\\sim$100\\,days, and an inferred $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.008 \\pm 0.002$\\,\\msun. The peak bolometric luminosity, L$_{\\rm bol} \\approx 10^{41.4}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$, and its spectral evolution is typical of other SNe in the class. Using our late-time spectra, we measure the [\\ion{O}{i}] $\\lambda\\lambda6300, 6364$ lines, which we compare against SN II spectral synthesis models to constrain the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass. We find this to be 12 $\\pm$ 3\\,\\msun. Our extensive late-time spectral coverage of the [\\ion{Fe}{ii}] $\\lambda7155$ and [\\ion{Ni}{ii}] $\\lambda7378$ lines permits a measurement of the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, a parameter sensitive to the inner progenitor structure and explosion mechanism dynamics. We measure a constant abundance ratio evolution of $0.081^{+0.009}_{-0.010}$, and argue that the best epochs to measure the ratio are at $\\sim$200 -- 300\\,days after explosion. We place this measurement in the context of a large sample of SNe II and compare against various physical, light-curve and spectral parameters, in search of trends which might allow indirect ways of constraining this ratio. We do not find correlations predicted by theoretical models; however, this may be the result of the exact choice of parameters and explosion mechanism in the models, the simplicity of them and/or primordial contamination in the measured abundance ratio."
