Every year a student-led conference that lasts for 2 and a half days is hosted at the University of Southampton which PGR students from SEPnet can attend to dig into the world of research conferences. I was the lead organizer in a committee of PGR students from the University of Southampton and University of Hertfordshire. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic we had to host a one-day conference online.

Dates: Sep 7-8, 2020
