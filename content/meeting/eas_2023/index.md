The upcoming generation of large-scale surveys (e.g., DESI, LSST, and Euclid) will observe enormous cosmological volumes with unprecedented precision. As a result, these surveys hold the promise of cosmological constraints with precision competitive with CMB experiments. On the other hand, current cosmological surveys deliver constraints that show significant tensions with more traditional approaches, in some cases up to 5 sigmas (e.g., the Hubble parameter, sigma8, etc). These tensions may result from model shortcomings, systematic effects, or even a missing element in our current understanding of the Universe. Therefore, to determine the origin of these tensions, it is necessary to utilize the full constraining power that new surveys will provide. It requires using more realistic theoretical models and non-traditional cosmological observables.

The primary objective of this session is to discuss the most recent developments in the extraction of statistical information from different types of observables, understanding of systematic effects, and in modelling techniques to constrain the cosmological model.
